## Create installation flash drive

-   Download official Windows iso
-   Install unetbootin
-   Create flash drive using unetbootin and Windows iso
-   Install `wimtools` (`brew install wimtools` on OS X)
-   Fix `sources/install.wim` file size (>4GB is too big for FAT32):
    ```bash
    rm /Volumes/usbflash/sources/install.wim
    wimsplit \
      /Volumes/winiso/sources/install.wim \
      /Volumes/usbflash/sources/install.swm \
      3000
    ```
-   Eject flash drive

## Install Windows

-   Boot from flash drive
-   Choose "I don't have a product key" (can be activated later)
-   Choose standard edition - no "Single Language" or "N" version or whatever.
-   After several restarts, when prompted with internet requirement for Microsoft Account login,
    hit Shift + F10 and run `OOBE\BYPASSNRO` and proceed without internet.
-   Note: You may need to also disable the network adapter through whatever various means.

### Alternative OOBE bypass methods

> [!NOTE]
> It's likely that the bypass method will break in the future, so some alternatives are below.

See [Windows 11 Setup Without Internet](https://www.minitool.com/news/windows-11-setup-without-internet.html) guide.

**Method 1** - `OOBE\BYPASSNRO`:

-   Press Shift + F10 when prompted for internet/login
-   Run `OOBE\BYPASSNRO`

**Method 2** - Task Manager:

-   Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager
-   Kill _Network Connection Flow_ process

**Method 3** - End network connection:

-   Shift + F10
-   Run `taskkill /F /IM oobenetworkconnectionflow.exe`

**Method 4** - Alt + F4

-   Simply press Alt + F4 on the "Letâ€™s connect you to a network" screen.

## Customize Windows

### System Settings

-   Taskbar settings
    -   Right-click taskbar => Taskbar settings
    -   Taskbar items => Search => Hide

### Performance monitoring

Install standard performance monitoring tools as soon as possible in order to keep an eye on important metrics such as temperature readings (especially for new machine build):

-   [CPU-Z](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html)
-   [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/)

### OpenJDK

[Install OpenJDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/install)

```bash
winget search Microsoft.OpenJDK
winget install Microsoft.OpenJDK.21  # adjust as needed
```

## WSL2

### Install WSL2

#### Enable Windows features for WSL

In an admin terminal (Windows key + X => "Terminal (Admin)"):

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

> [!NOTE]
> These steps can also be done via the "Turn Windows features on or off" dialog in the Control Panel, but for convenience these can simply be pasted into the terminal to achieve the same result.

### Debian

#### Install Debian:

```powershell
wsl --install -d Debian
```

#### Update packages:

```powershell
wsl
```

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### Enable systemd

Add the following in `/etc/wsl.conf`:

```init
[boot]
systemd=true
```

### Enable SSH server

#### Install `openssh-server`:

In a WSL shell, install `openssh-server`:

```bash
sudo apt install jq openssh-server
sudo service ssh start
```

#### _Optional_: Disable MOTD banner:

Disable the hideous "ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY" message banner:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/motd
```

#### Configure firewall:

-   Open Windows Firewall and click on "Advanced settings".
-   Inbound Rules > New Rule.
-   Select Port, click Next, and specify the SSH port (default is 22).
-   Allow the connection, and make sure it applies to Domain, Private, and Public.
-   Name the rule (e.g., "WSL2 SSH").

#### Configure netsh portproxy:

Determine the WSL VM's internal IP address by running `ip addr | grep 'inet 172'` in WSL - e.g. `172.28.43.167`.

Then outside of WSL, configure a netsh portproxy:

```bash
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 ssh 172.28.43.167 ssh
```

> [!NOTE]
> The portproxy setting survives reboots, but WSL IP addresses change frequently, so you'll need to reconfigure the portproxy by using `netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 ssh` and then repeating the aforementioned steps.

#### Configure `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`:

Enabling password-based login can help with bootstrapping the authorized keys:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/ssh/ssd_config
# (Enable `PasswordAuthentication`)
sudo service ssh restart
```

Determine the main Windows (not WSL) IP address by running `ipconfig` - e.g. `192.168.1.214`.

Connect via ssh using a password to populate the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file with your public key - e.g. `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
ssh 192.168.1.214
umask 077
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# (paste public key)
```

_Optional_: Disable password-based login by disabling `PasswordAuthentication` as described above.

#### Confirm SSH setup:

Confirm that you can connect using passwordless login:

```bash
ssh 192.168.1.214
```

#### _Optional_: Configure DHCP and DNS:

Consider enabling DHCP in your router settings so that Windows gets a predictable IP address.  Then also configure DNS either in your router settings, or by writing an entry in `/etc/hosts`.

### Perform standard Nucleus setup for Debian

Refer to [install-debian.md](./install-debian.md).

### Additional WSL-specific Debian setup:

#### _Nvidia-only_: Link `nvidia-smi`:

```bash
ln -s /usr/lib/wsl/lib/nvidia-smi ~/bin/
```

> [!WARNING]
> As mentioned in the [CUDA on WSL User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html#cuda-support-for-wsl-2):
>
> > users must not install any NVIDIA GPU Linux driver within WSL 2. One has to be very careful here as the default CUDA Toolkit comes packaged with a driver, and it is easy to overwrite the WSL 2 NVIDIA driver with the default installation.
>

## Docker

Install [Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) and follow all the prompts, selecting WSL2 as the backend.

Once Docker Desktop is running, in the settings => Resources => WSL Integration, check "Enable integration with additional distros."

### Configure symlink(s)

You might encounter errors like this when running `docker build ...` when connecting to WSL2 over ssh:

```
error getting credentials - err: exec: "docker-credential-desktop.exe": executable file not found in $PATH
```

Apparently WSL2 sets additional environment variables when running a shell locally, as compared to connecting via ssh, and part of the shell setup includes adjusting `$PATH` to point to additional Docker binaries.  One in particular is the `docker-credential-desktop.exe`.  It's not clear when/where/why/how this `$PATH` setup happens, but a targeted workaround is to symlink the file into `~/bin`:

```bash
ln -s /mnt/c/Program\ Files/Docker/Docker/resources/bin/docker-credential-desktop.exe ~/bin/
```

> [!NOTE]
> The entire directory could be added to the path, but it's probably better to be a bit more targeted here with the least amount of additional system customization.
