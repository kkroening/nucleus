## Create installation flash drive

-   Download official Windows iso
-   Install unetbootin
-   Create flash drive using unetbootin and Windows iso
-   Install `wimtools` (`brew install wimtools` on OS X)
-   Fix `sources/install.wim` file size (>4GB is too big for FAT32):
    ```bash
    rm /Volumes/usbflash/sources/install.wim
    wimsplit \
      /Volumes/winiso/sources/install.wim \
      /Volumes/usbflash/sources/install.swm \
      3000
    ```
-   Eject flash drive

## Install Windows

-   Boot from flash drive
-   Choose "I don't have a product key" (can be activated later)
-   Choose standard edition - no "Single Language" or "N" version or whatever.
-   After several restarts, when prompted with internet requirement for Microsoft Account login,
    hit Shift + F10 and run `OOBE\BYPASSNRO` and proceed without internet.
-   Note: You may need to also disable the network adapter through whatever various means.

-   Kill _Network Connection Flow_ process

**Method 3** - End network connection:

**Method 4** - Alt + F4

## Customize Windows

### System Settings

-   Taskbar settings
    -   Right-click taskbar => Taskbar settings
    -   Taskbar items => Search => Hide
    -   Taskbar items => All off
    -   Other system tray icons => Windows Security + Safely Remove Hardware on, all others off

    -   _(TODO)_
-   Night light

### Chrome

-   Use Edge to install Chrome, and don't be swayed by the pleas to stick with Edge
-   Set as default browser: Win + I => Default apps => Google Chrome => Set default
-   Launch Chrome
-   Chrome settings - `about:settings`
    -    Hamburger menu => Downloads => Ask where to save each file before downloading

### Performance monitoring

Install standard performance monitoring tools as soon as possible in order to keep an eye on important metrics such as temperature readings (especially for new machine build):

-   [CPU-Z](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html)
-   [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/)
-   [HWMonitor](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html)
-   [Corsair iCUE](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/s/downloads)
-   [Samsung Magician](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/consumer-storage/magician/)
-   [ASRock Motherboard Utility ver:4.0.72](https://download.asrock.com/Utility/MotherboardUtility/MotherboardUtility(v4.0.72).zip)

> **Tip**: After installing each app, to prevent being prompted for administrator permission every time, right click each desktop icon and select properties.  Then in the shortcut => advanced settings, enable _Run as administrator_.
