## Python

```bash
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 2.7.14
pyenv install 3.7.3

pyenv shell 2.7.14
pip install -U pip
pip install -U virtualenv

pyenv shell 3.7.3
pip install -U pip
pip install -U virtualenv

pyenv global 2.7.14 3.7.3
```

**pyenv-virtualenv (TBD)**:

If you see the following error, `pyenv-virtualenv` may need to be installed:
```
pyenv: no such command `virtualenv-init'
```

In this case, install `pyenv-virtualenv`:
```bash
brew install pyenv-virtualenv
```

_Source_: [pyenv: no such command `virtualenv' (Stack Overflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67676109).

> _**Note**_: It's not clear why this pyenv plugin is even needed, so this sub-section may be unnecessary.

## Nucleus installation (part 2)

> _**Note**_: This second part of the nucleus installation must be done *after* Python is set up.

```bash
cd ~/nucleus
virtualenv venv \
  && venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
virtualenv venv2 -p "$(which python2)" \
  && venv2/bin/pip install -r requirements-py2.txt
```

## Install packages via homebrew

> _**Note**_: The `brew install` items in this section are optional, so season the commands to taste.

> _**Note**_: Some particularly tricky package installations are shown separately (e.g. `ffmpeg`).

**Assorted packages (optional):**

```bash
brew install \
  ctags \
  direnv \
  htop \
  mdcat \
  fswatch \
  nvm \
  vim \
  watch
```

**ffmpeg (optional):**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg --with-sdl2 --with-freetype --with-fontconfig --with-libass
```

**universal-ctags (optional):**
```bash
brew install --HEAD universal-ctags/universal-ctags/universal-ctags
```

```

# Minimal terminal setup

If nucleus can't be installed for whatever reason, this section has the bare-minimal steps to configure a semi-reasonable terminal environment.

Write minimal `~/.bash_profile`:
```bash
PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
PATH=~/bin:${PATH}

if which pyenv > /dev/null; then
    eval "$(pyenv init -)"
fi

if [[ "${OSTYPE}" == "darwin"* ]]; then
    PATH=/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH
    MANPATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman:$MANPATH"
fi
```

Install pathogen.vim:
``` bash
mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle && \
curl -LSso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://tpo.pe/pathogen.vim
```

Write a minimal `~/.vimrc` by stripping down the nucleus `~/.vimrc`.

# Extra

## f.lux

[f.lux download](https://justgetflux.com)

Set bedtime color to 2700K.

## Spotify

```bash
curl -Lo - https://download.scdn.co/SpotifyInstaller.zip | bsdtar -x
open "Install Spotify.app"
```

## Karabiner Elements

Karabiner elements for emulating numpad with Blender:
- https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/127

## yEd

- [Download yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed/download#download)
- File => Preferences => Editor:
  - Check _Edit Label on Create Node_
  - Check _Dynamically Adjust Node Size to Label Size_

## Fix monitor issue:

- Remove `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist`
- Remove `Users/karlk/Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.*`
- nvram/pram reset: power off, then hit power then hold Command+Option+P+R for about 30 seconds; screen should flash twice
- smc reset: power off then cmd+option+shift+power
- edit: this doesn't actually fix it or even seem to make a difference.

## Various optional apps:

- `brew install mdcat`

# Ubuntu installation instructions

Follow _some_ of the above instructions (judiciously).

_TODO: pull out common parts of the above and fill in this section.  For now it's just a collection of various notes._

## pyenv

Perform the `apt-get install` commands listed in pyenv's [Common build problems](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems#prerequisites) article first, then follow the instructions in the [pyenv-installer readme](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer).  Be sure to make the `~/.bashrc` changes suggested in the `pyenv-installer` output.  Finally, set vim as the default editor using `sudo update-alternatives --config editor`.

At the time of this writing, the entire process looks like this:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
  build-essential \
  curl \
  git
  libbz2-dev \
  libffi-dev \
  liblzma-dev \
  libncurses5-dev \
  libncursesw5-dev \
  libreadline-dev \
  libsqlite3-dev \
  libssl-dev \
  llvm \
  make \
  python-openssl \
  tk-dev \
  wget \
  xz-utils \
  zlib1g-dev \
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
echo "export PATH=\"${PYENV_ROOT}/bin:\$PATH\""
echo "eval \"\$(pyenv init -)\""
echo "eval \"\$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)\""
sudo update-alternatives --config editor
```

> _**Note**_: Some of the above apt packages may be redundant/unnecessary.

> _**Note**_: The `~/.bashrc` changes are already included in nucleus' `.bashrc` file.

## pyflakes-vim

[pyflakes-vim](https://github.com/kevinw/pyflakes-vim) is officially deprecated, but it's still my favorite vim Python plugin due to its simplicity and speed (as compared to [ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) and [Syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic) which are horrifyingly slow out of the box, to the point of being completely unusable).

`pyflakes-vim` should work with a standard `apt install vim python-flake8` (or maybe `python3-pyflakes`), so long as Pathogen and pyflakes-vim are present in the appropriate `~/.vim` directories (e.g. by symlinking the corresponding nucleus submodules).

## NVIDIA GPU drivers / Tensorflow-GPU

The NVIDIA GPU drivers should be installed as part of the Tensorflow-GPU setup to ensure that all the drivers and various CUDA/cuDNN libraries are compatible.  Currently, the best place to look for instructions is in the [Tensorflow GPU support article](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#ubuntu_1804_cuda_101), but do jump straight to the "Ubuntu 18.04" section and don't get distracted by the other section that points you to a bunch of rabbit-hole links in the "Software requirements" section. (All of this will probably change by the time this install guide is revisited, but alas.)

If the system gets into a weird state with conflicting library versions, it seems to be safe to do a heavy `sudo apt purge *nvidia* *cuda* *cudnn* && sudo apt autoremove` to eradicate everything and start fresh, so long as you have `nouveau` drivers for backup after the nvidia drivers are wiped and/or are comfortable working from a recovery mode shell and reinstalling things from there.

If you encounter errors during NVIDIA driver installation due to drivers already being in use or nouveau needing to be disabled, simply reboot into a recovery mode shell, enable networking with `sudo service networking start && sudo dhclient && some other stuff` and repeat the installation there.  (Or avoid needing networking in that situation by installing via dpkg).

The `nvidia-smi` tool is your friend to help figure out what's going on, as it shows the current NVIDIA drivers in use, or logs an error if the drivers aren't loaded.

Once everything's set up, running a Tensorflow example should cause a GPU usage spike that should be apparent in the `nvidia-smi` output (e.g. `watch -n 1 nvidia-smi`).  If there's no GPU usage spike but the Tensorflow example finishes anyways, there's a good chance it simply fell back to CPU execution.  Also, if running `tensorboard` doesn't work then you still have work to do.

## Steam

After installing the NVIDIA drivers as described above, it's also necessary to install some 32-bit dependencies in order for Steam to work:

```bash
sudo apt install libnvidia-gl-440:i386
```

Then install Steam "as usual." (My process this time around was to download the official Steam `.deb` file from the Steam website, install it with dpkg, then `sudo apt install steam`, but there might be a less roundabout way)

See also: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/5553#issuecomment-402396591

These also seem to be necessary:
```bash
sudo apt install \
  libbz2-1.0:i386 \
  libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0:i386 \
  libglib2.0-0:i386 \
  libgtk2.0-0:i386 \
  libpulse0:i386 \
  libva2:i386 \
  libva-x11-2:i386 \
  libvdpau1:i386 \
  libxrandr2:i386 \
  libxtst6:i386
```

## Misc

### Limit alt+tab switching to the current workspace only:
```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.app-switcher current-workspace-only true
```

### Enable alt-left + alt-right keys in terminal

Write the following to `~/.inputrc`:
```
"\e[1;3D": backward-word ### Alt left
"\e[1;3C": forward-word ### Alt right
```

See [stackexchange post 108098](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/108098/alt-left-to-skip-words-does-not-work-in-terminal-emulators).
